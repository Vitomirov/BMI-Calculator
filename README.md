Java BMI Calculator

This simple Java BMI Calculator project allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight inputs. The BMI is then used to determine the user's weight status, whether they are underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.
Features

    BMI Calculation: The calculator accurately computes the BMI using the provided height and weight inputs.
    BMI Categorization: It categorizes the calculated BMI into different weight status categories.
    Input Validation: The program ensures that user inputs are valid, handling cases of invalid inputs gracefully.
    Max Available Height and Weight Limit: The calculator restricts inputs to reasonable values, with a maximum height of 250 cm and a maximum weight of 200 kg.
    User-Friendly Interface: The application provides clear prompts for user inputs and displays results in an easy-to-understand format.

How to Use
